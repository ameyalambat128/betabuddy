This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Beta Buddy 
Beta Buddy is a rock climbing database and website built for our capstone project at ASU. The project aims to create a database of local climbing gyms of different routes and their difficulties. The User should be able to go to the website and upload any images of their local gyms to add to our database. Additionally, users who are looking to find the route to certain difficulties can query the database and it will return the difficulty levels of the routes seen in the images. We also built an algorithm that can detect the holds on the images using Artificial Intelligence.
